## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:

*  Version Control Systems (VCSs) Benefits are:  Project files cannot be overwritten, a common repository holds all the recent files, and project team members may work on the same files concurrently absent of conflict. In addition to facilitating team collaborations, VCSs are instrumental in backing up files for individual users so that these users will not lose their work or have to start a project over from scratch.

* Basic Git commands are: git init, git add, git commit, git push, git status, and git pull.
   
* Local and remote repositories differences were presented on.
